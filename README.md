Python Project Euler

This repository is just a place for me to drop my Python Jupyter notebooks for my workings on questions from the Project Euler archive. This site is available to view over at https://projecteuler.net/archives and it is worth your time if you are interested in a challenge or just practice in coding. You can use any programming language to solve the problems, (I previously attempted some in VBA through Excel just to see if I could), buy I am using this as a way to get to grips with Python.

I have no doubt there are much better ways to find the answers, these are just my ways. I'm really new to all of this so I may come back and re-try some of these at a later date to see if I can improve them.
