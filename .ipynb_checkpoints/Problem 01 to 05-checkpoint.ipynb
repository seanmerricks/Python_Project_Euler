If the product of z can be divided by 2 with a remainder of 0 we know it to be an even number so it is added to the answer, if it is odd it is ignored.

    "In this problem the main driver is quickly finding a way to work a large number down to a manageable test range rather than run through every number from 1 through to the upper limit. This took a big of digging into primality testing which I wasn't overly familiar with other than by manually testing with low numbers. After a bit of research I found a way to test large numbers that seems to work. Firstly I set the test criteria to only run while x is less than the square root of the upper limit. As soon as you go above the square root of a number you start to see duplications in mutiples with the factors being reversed for instance with 16 you only test numbers up to 4 as the square root, above that you see the same factors of 8 x 2 which you alread see as 2 x 8. Within the test criteria I then check if the current test value of x is a factor of the number by checking if the remainder is 0. If it does cleanly divide the test number I then divide the test number by the current x (as we know it is a factor) and set this as the new test number. I then test it again to see if x can cleanly divide into the new test number, if it doe I repeat the process of dividing it by x and re-asigning the test number. If there is any remainder the value of x is increased by 1 and the test continues. At the point that x cannot cleanly divide the test number and it exceeds the square root of the current test number we know it is a prime number and it is returned as the answer."

If they match each other the number is palidromic and I then test if the current working answer is higher than the previous highest answer, if it is I overwrite the highest current answer. The programme starts at x and y both being 999 and tests x as 999 multiplied by y as 999 through to y as 1 then it resets y to 999 and lowers x to 998 and starts the whole loop again. The programme runs through this process of rapidly decreasing y down from 999 to 1 and then lowering x by 1 until both x and y are 1."

    "This solution is rather simple in structure but takes a while to run just due to the size of number that it needs to calculate. The script runs until the variable answer does not equal 0, as soon as a value is asigned the loop finishes and the answer is returned. The loop starts with x  set to 1 and y set to 20 and tests if x divided by y leaves no remainder. If it does y is a factor of x so we decrease y to 19 and test if that is a factor. As soon as x divided by y leaves a remainder we know this is not the aswer so we increase x by 1 (giving the next number to test) and reset y to 20 (to start testing again). The reason I start y at 20 and work backwards down to 1 to test factors is that a lot more numbers have smaller numbers as factors so checking if 20 is a factor first really speeds up the test loop."
